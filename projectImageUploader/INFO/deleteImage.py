# Q. If you deleted the object of image data in from you DB will it also delete the 
# image from the folder?

"""No, deleting the database object (e.g., a model instance) that represents an
 image in Django does not automatically delete the corresponding image file 
 from the storage folder. You need to handle the file deletion separately.

When you delete a model instance that has an associated image field, Django,
by default, doesn't delete the corresponding file from the storage.
This behavior is intentional to prevent accidental data loss, as deleting 
database records should not always imply the desire to delete associated files.

To delete the file along with the database object, you can override the `delete`
 method of your model to include the file deletion logic. Here's an example:

"""
from django.db import models
import os

class YourModel(models.Model):
    image = models.ImageField(upload_to='uploads/')

    def delete(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Delete the file from storage
        storage, path = self.image.storage, self.image.path
        storage.delete(path)

        # Call the parent class delete method
        super().delete(*args, **kwargs)


"""In this example, the `delete` method is overridden to first delete the associated 
file using the `delete` method of the storage backend (which could be the default
 Django storage or a custom storage you've configured).

Make sure to adapt the example according to your actual model structure and storage
 settings. Always exercise caution when dealing with file deletion to avoid 
 unintended data loss."""
