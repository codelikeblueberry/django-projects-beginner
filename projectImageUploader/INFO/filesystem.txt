By default, Django stores files locally, using the MEDIA_ROOT 
and MEDIA_URL settings. The examples below assume that youâ€™re
 using these defaults.

However, Django provides ways to write custom file storage
 systems that allow you to completely customize where and 
 how Django stores files.


    Q. WHY USING DATABASE MODEL TO RETREIVE AND SAVE IMAGE FROM FOLDERS.
    A. YOU CAN ALSO DO IT WITHOUT CREATING MODEL AND ONLY DJANGO FORMS.
    FOR THAT YOU REQUIRE ONLY THE FORM DATA AND SAVE THAT FORM DATA?

    MODEL ISILIYE BANAYA TAAKI IMAGE FILE KI DETAILS JO BHI CHAHIYE THI
    LIKE IMAGE NAME AUR JO IMAGE_FILED KE ATTRIBUTED ME BHARE JAANEWALI CHEEZI THI
    WOH SAARE SQL LITE DB ME SAVE HO RAHI HAIN.
